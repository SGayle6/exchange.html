			<li> Develop an open mind. At the beginning of a cultural exchange
				experience, approach new situations with curiosity. Ask lots of
				questions and consider the way culture may shape your
				interactions. Most important, do not shy away from new
				experiences with people who may think differently from you; it will
				help you develop empathy and cross-cultural skills.			</li>

			<li>Become more independent. Moving to a new country to teach is a
				big step for your independence and will help you grow selfconfidence and a sense of accomplishment.
			</li>

			<li>Appreciate new perspectives and ways of living. You will learn so
				much from your new colleagues and neighbors, from what they do
				on the weekends to what motivates them in their work. Walk in
				their shoes and alongside them on this journey as much as you
				can.
			</li>

			<li>
			Meet people from all over the world. Did you know that
			ambassador teachers with Participate Learning come from 29
			countries? Who will you meet during your teaching experience?			</li>

			<li>
			Travel within the country. Whether you use long holiday weekends
			or summer breaks, set travel goals for yourself during your stay so
			you can explore new places.			</li>

			<li>
			Be a cultural ambassador for your home country. You may be the
			first person your school community has met from your home
			country! Use your cultural exchange as an opportunity to be a
			cultural ambassador and share your expertise with those around
			you.
			</li>

			<li>
			Unite our world through global learning. When you partner with us
			for cultural exchange, you play a meaningful role in cultivating
			global leaders who create a more peaceful world. The
			connections you make in your classroom and community make a
			lasting impact.
